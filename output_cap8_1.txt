Here is the list of inputs:
OPTIONS jobs 2
OPTIONS queues 2
OPTIONS allotments for queue  1 is   1
OPTIONS quantum length for queue  1 is  10
OPTIONS allotments for queue  0 is   1
OPTIONS quantum length for queue  0 is  10
OPTIONS boost 0
OPTIONS ioTime 5
OPTIONS stayAfterIO False
OPTIONS iobump False


For each job, three defining characteristics are given:
  startTime : at what time does the job enter the system
  runTime   : the total CPU time needed by the job to finish
  ioFreq    : every ioFreq time units, the job issues an I/O
              (the I/O takes ioTime units to complete)

Job List:
  Job  0: startTime   0 - runTime  30 - ioFreq   0
  Job  1: startTime  20 - runTime  20 - ioFreq   0
